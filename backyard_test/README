This code is based off of the code online called SWISS_AUTOMATION_WITH_DATA_LOGGER

This code is being written to try and test the power on all the parts and try and figure out
what is causing the valco communication problems (& maybe power problems)

I'm going to set up this code so it goes off every hour, and goes through the sample protocol every 5 Hours
--> Takes 25 hours to run in total

*later iteration should check the rtc.setAlarm2(0 . 14) sets off at 2 pm

What I want to change probably:
1. A better way to time the sampling protocol (not just delay)
2. The sampleday counter -> depends on not losing any power



Notes:
1. The SMC valves are active LOW. Initialize as HIGH, and they open on LOW
2. On Sample75 function added a probebypass line
3. Changed the alarm time so that it sets off at 14 hours rather than 14 minutes.
