# SWISS_Automation
This repository is for my early attempts and iterations of automating the SWISS. 

There are multiple kinds of automation codes in this repository. I have codes for both aspects of making lab work more efficient, and to make the SWISS fully automated in a field setting

1. Components/Parts: 
1.	Arduino Mega 2560 (Note: If you don’t add any other peripherals other than what is listed below this should also be possible with an Arduino Uno). 
2.	USB 2.0 Cable type A/B
3.	Bread board (I use a 400 point, but it’s possible to get away with smaller, especially if the RS232 converter is soldered with wires). 
4.	Digital Loggers IoT relay 
5.	Sparkfun DeadOn RTC DS3234 
6.	Coin cell battery (to power the RTC)
7.	RS232 to TTL Converter with Male DB9 
8.	Sparkfun OpenLog
9.	32 GB or smaller microSD w/ adapter (to put into SD card slot on comp)
10.	SMC valves –> 
a)	VVX214BO4B - manifold base
b)	VX2A0AZ1EH – SMC 2 port valve
c)	KQ2H07-36NS – SMC fitting for the sides
d)	KQ2H07-35NS – SMC fitting for the front
11.	Relay board 
12.	Female to male jumper wires 
13.	Terminal block – you’ll need 8 positions (4 voltage, 4 ground)
14.	16 AWG standard wire 
15.	Hookup wire
16.	Field Power
a)	Deep Cycle battery (Windy Nation)
b)	100 W, 12 V Grape Solar or Renogy kit. Renogy is nice because you can one stop shop the battery, solar panel kit and the power inverter  
c)	12V DC to 120V AC Power inverter
